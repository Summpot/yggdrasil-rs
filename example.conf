  # List of outbound peer connection strings (e.g. tls://a.b.c.d:e or
  # socks://a.b.c.d:e/f.g.h.i:j). Connection strings can contain options,
  # see https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/configurationref.html#peers.
  # Yggdrasil has no concept of bootstrap nodes - all network traffic
  # will transit peer connections. Therefore make sure to only peer with
  # nearby nodes that have good connectivity and low latency. Avoid adding
  # peers to this list from distant countries as this will worsen your
  # node's connectivity and performance considerably.
  Peers: []

  # Listen addresses for incoming connections. You will need to add
  # listeners in order to accept incoming peerings from non-local nodes.
  # This is not required if you wish to establish outbound peerings only.
  # Multicast peer discovery will work regardless of any listeners set
  # here. Each listener should be specified in URI format as above, e.g.
  # tls://0.0.0.0:0 or tls://[::]:0 to listen on all interfaces.
  Listen: []

  # Listen address for admin connections. Default is to listen for local
  # connections either on TCP/9001 or a UNIX socket depending on your
  # platform. Use this value for yggdrasilctl -endpoint=X. To disable
  # the admin socket, use the value "none" instead.

  # Configuration for which interfaces multicast peer discovery should be
  # enabled on. Regex is a regular expression which is matched against an
  # interface name, and interfaces use the first configuration that they
  # match against. Beacon controls whether or not your node advertises its
  # presence to others, whereas Listen controls whether or not your node
  # listens out for and tries to connect to other advertising nodes. See
